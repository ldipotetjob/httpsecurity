## This document is refered to Restful WSO2 api manager ##

Our goals: 
- Make a sign up 
- This new user has to be capable of:
  - add new applications 
  - subcribe to new Apis
  
### Sign up: ###
  
 ```sh
 curl 'http://localhost:9763/store/site/blocks/user/sign-up/ajax/user-add.jag' -H 'Accept: application/json' -d 'action=addUser&username=myusername&password=PyPassword1&allFieldsValues=Kim|Hill|ABC Network|30 Palm Road,Pasadena,California|USA|kim@abcnetwork.com|0016269934122|0016269934134|kimhill|www.abcNsounds.org/'
 ```
 Some details about previous curl command:
 - password ,ost be a combination of uppercases,lowercase and digits. checke this point in WSO2 documentation. 
 - **allFieldsValues** parameter is **mandatory** if you do not need all of then leave empty as explain in the next parameters.  
 - be prepared for this response:
   - {"error" : false, "showWorkflowTip" : false} : means everything ok. In the same way when something is wrong responses can be ambiguous or lead confusion.
 - If want to be prepared for all responses:
   - *<WSO2_HOME>/repository/deployment/server/jaggeryapps/store/site/blocks/user/sign-up/ajax/user-add.jag*
   
  Sign up with just few info(**pay attention to the module bar(|)**):

### Add new applications: ###

The workflow when you create an application in WSO2 is quite different when it is done via web console than when it is done via WSO2 restful api.

It not clear in the documentation even though we have a reference that explain [RestFul api for deal with WSO2(https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM210/apidocs/store/index.html).

For create a new application a user will need **to obtain first an Authorization token Bearer** the first thing that the user should has is **Internal/subscriber** role, it use to be default role for every user.
This will be our workflow:
1. Client Registration for get the proper pair  ***client-id:client secret***.
2. Token generation for get the token bearer.
3. Generate the application with the token generated in the previous step.

We need the previous steps (1-2) for each process that require **Authorization: Bearer** as is the case of ***creation of new applications***

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic ZGFueXlvOkxkZ3RnZXBkejE=" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @payload.json http://localhost:9763/client-registration/v0.12/register
```
Remenber that for basic authorization whe need encode64, our Authorization parameter at the Header, by the way remember that in Authorization: Basic <encode64(userid:password)> and **userid is case sensitive** see [Basic and Digest Access Authentication specefications](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617#page-5)

[You can find a reference to process 1-2](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM210/apidocs/store/index.html#guide)
