### Add new applications: ###

The workflow when you create an application in WSO2 is quite different when it is done via web console than or when it is done by Restful api.

It it not clear in the documentation. So we have a reference, there is a document that explain [RestFull api for deal with WSO2](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM210/apidocs/store/index.html).

For create a new application a user will need **to obtain first an Authorization token Bearer** the first thing than our user    should has is **Internal/subscriber** role, it used to  be by default.
This will be our workflow:
1. Client Registration for get the proper pair ***client-id:client secret*** .
2. Token generation for get the token bearer.
3. Generate the application with the token generated in  the previous step.

We need the previous steps (1-2) for each process that require **Authorization: Bearer** as is the case of ***creation of new applications***

```sh
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Basic ZGFueXlvOkxkZ3RnZXBkejE=" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @payload.json http://localhost:9763/client-registration/v0.12/register
```
Remenber that for basic authorization whe need encode64 our Authorization parameter at the Header by the way remember that in Authorization: Basic <encode64(userid:password)> and **userid is case sensitive** see Basic and [Digest Access Authentication specefications](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617#page-5)

[You can find a reference to process 1-2](https://docs.wso2.com/display/AM210/apidocs/store/index.html#guide)
